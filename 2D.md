# GameChangers 2D Game Dev Tutorial

## Description
CCEE GameChangers (2018) is summer camp hosted by the UNC-CH School of Education, focused on honing the skills of young individuals in the field of game development.

In this tutorial, we will be using GameMaker Studio 2 to build a 2D space shooter. Below there are links to instructional videos for specific topics involved in building our 2D game. Topics covered include: Sprites, Objects, Enemies, Movement, Input, Tilesets, Backgrounds, Rooms, Spawning, and Audio.

Under each description, I will include the code from each part.

### [Intro, Movement, Shooting](https://youtu.be/CiGLvAYGRxE) (52:43)
In this video, we'll cover adding sprites to our game, which we will use as our player character. We'll add controls that enable us to move the player character and shoot projectiles. This video is sort of long and starts out by explaining some of the basics of GameMaker Studio 2. Therefore, in the description of each video on YouTube, I've added timestamps for when I begin talking about each topic. Feel free to click these timestamps to skip to that topic. Click on the title of this section to watch the video!

#### Here's the code:
**obj_player** :
* Create
    ```javascript
    max_speed = 9;
    fire_rate = 15;
    ```
* Step
    ```javascript
    //Inputs

    if (keyboard_check(ord("W")) || keyboard_check(vk_up)) {
        //y = y - spd;
        speed = speed + 0.4;
    } else if (keyboard_check(ord("S")) || keyboard_check(vk_down)) {
        //y = y + spd;
        speed = speed - 0.2;
    } else {
        if(speed > 0) {
            speed = speed - 0.1;
        } else if(speed < 0) {
            speed = speed + 0.1;	
        }	
    }

    if (keyboard_check(ord("A")) || keyboard_check(vk_left)) {
        //x = x - spd;
        direction = direction + 3;
    }

    if (keyboard_check(ord("D")) || keyboard_check(vk_right)) {
        //x = x + spd;
        direction = direction - 3;
    }

    if(mouse_check_button(mb_left) || keyboard_check(vk_space)) {
        if(fire_rate <= 0) {
            fire_rate = 15;
            instance_create_layer(x, y, "Projectiles", obj_bullet);
        }
    }

    //Makes sure we stay below speed limit 
    if(speed >= max_speed) {
        speed = max_speed;
    }

    fire_rate = fire_rate - 1;
    
    image_angle = direction;
    ```
**obj_bullet** :
* Create
    ```javascript
    direction = obj_player.direction;
    speed = 16;
    image_angle = direction;
    ```

### [Enemies](https://youtu.be/01pAJBQxLr4) (9:40)
Now we'll cover adding enemies that follow our player character to our game. We'll also logic to the bullets so that they can destroy the enemies. Additionally, we'll make it so that when the enemies collide with the player, it restarts the game. I've put the code along from this video below. If there is code that is associated with a game object that already exists, I've simply added the entire object's code (some of which you've already typed out).

#### Here's more code:

**obj_enemy** :
* Create
    ```javascript
    hp = 2;
    spd = 1.5;
    ```
* Step
    ```javascript
    if (instance_exists(obj_player)) {
        move_towards_point(obj_player.x, obj_player.y, spd);
    }

    image_angle = direction;

    if (hp <= 0) {
        obj_player.player_score = obj_player.player_score + 1;
        instance_destroy();
    }
    ```
* Collision w/ obj_player
    ```javascript
    game_restart();
    ```


**obj_bullet** :
* Collision w/ obj_enemy
    ```javascript
    with(other) {
        hp = hp - 1;	
    }

    instance_destroy();
    ```

### [Tilesets, Backgrounds](https://youtu.be/0bSzFpYe3gE) (16:34)
Now we'll go over how to add and use tilesets to decorate our game, as well as, how to add a background. There's no code to go with this one! :D

### [Audio, Title Screen](https://youtu.be/l95mcljzXww) (9:52)
Now let's clean up our rooms, add a Title Screen to welcome our players, then we'll add some A E S T H E T I C music. (Created by a former camper!)

#### Even more code:
**obj_music**
* Create
    ```javascript
    audio_play_sound(bg_music,10,true);
    ```
**obj_title**
* Create
    ```javascript
    image_alpha = 0;
    x = room_width / 2;
    y = room_height / 2;
    ```
* Step
    ```javascript
    image_alpha = min(image_alpha+0.001,1);
    ```
* Key Up - Enter
    ```javascript
    room_goto_next();
    ```
### [Score, Text](https://youtu.be/XGDitKGKVgE) (5:51)
We're going to look at how to add text to our game so that we can keep track of our player's score. Then we'll add logic that keeps track of our score while playing the game. Towards the end of the video, I go over how to randomly spawn enemies outside the window. If there is code that is associated with a game object that already exists, I've simply added the entire object's code (some of which you've already typed out).

#### And yet, even more code:
**obj_player** :
* Create
    ```javascript
    max_speed = 9;
    fire_rate = 15;
    player_score = 0;
    ```
**obj_enemy** :
* Step
    ```javascript
    if (instance_exists(obj_player)) {
        move_towards_point(obj_player.x, obj_player.y, spd);
    }

    image_angle = direction;

    if (hp <= 0) {
        obj_player.player_score = obj_player.player_score + 1;
        instance_destroy();
    }
    ```
**obj_score** :
* Draw GUI
    ```javascript
    draw_set_color(c_white);
    draw_set_font(f_score);
    draw_text(50, 50, obj_player.player_score);
    ```
### [Spawning](https://youtu.be/3IbLoQ0njKM) (16:13)
Let's make this game even MORE interesting by adding enemy spawners!

#### You guessed it! More code:

**obj_spawner**
* Create
    ```javascript
    spawn_rate = 60;
    alarm[0] = spawn_rate;
    spawned = 0;
    ```
* Alarm 0
    ```javascript
    rand = irandom(4);

    if(spawned <= 20) {
        if(rand == 1) {
            instance_create_layer(-30 + random(-30), random(room_height), "Enemy", obj_enemyspawn);
        } else if(rand == 2) {
            instance_create_layer(30 + room_width + random(-30), random(room_height), "Enemy", obj_enemyspawn);
        } else if(rand == 3) {
            instance_create_layer(random(room_width), room_height + 30 + random(-30), "Enemy", obj_enemyspawn);
        } else if(rand == 4) {
            instance_create_layer(random(room_width), -30 + random(-30), "Enemy", obj_enemyspawn);	
        }
    }

    alarm[0] = spawn_rate;
    ```
**obj_enemyspawn**
* Create
    ```javascript
    image_xscale = 0.1;
    image_yscale = 0.1;
    obj_spawner.spawned = obj_spawner.spawned + 1;
    ```
* Step
    ```
    image_xscale = min(image_xscale+0.02,1);
    image_yscale = image_xscale;

    if(image_xscale == 1) {
        instance_change(obj_enemy,true);
    }
    ```


That's it for now.
